# ADDI - Prospect Leads

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. \
and also runs a fake backend using json-server [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

I have used Create React App to start this project because is an easy way to start and it allow extend the configuration as you need. \
I'm using styled-component for styling because is a powerfull module for creating components.

Because of time, there are missing some things like spinners and some animations for better user experiences. \
And also the design could be better but it is one of my weakness, I'm not good doing designs.

I would have liked a better description on how implement the backend on the data source.
